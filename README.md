In this visualization it shows the U.S. citizens Deaths in foreign countries. The dataset has about 13,000 data entries in it and is from the Travel.State.Gov website. At first appearance, you are defaulted to the all the foreign countries data put togther with a pie chart and a table chart. The pie will have 8 different slices that are color coded to a table chart of cause of death. The data scales each slice of pie depending on the number of deaths in a category that year. The table chart will display the exact numbers of each slice of the pie for my precision of data. There is a play button on top left corner where users can press to increment through the data each year to see the pie to dynamically change through each year (along with table chart changing with pie). You can pause the pie at any time and restart at the same position a user stops at. Also, you have a slider at the bottom that allows a user to choose a specified year.

In the Compare Different Year button, a user is able to add another pie that has the same data to compare a different year. The Pie 2 has a slider to specify year and the table chart shows exact number of deaths in a category. Both pies have dashed circles around it so that a user can compare each pie of slice size to see subtle differences. Also, the table chart will allow user to see exact numbers of each deaths between the two years.

If you press the Individual Countries button, this takes a user to a new visualization that will focus on countries data. A user can select a country and be able to use the slider to see data from a year it has data for. If a user mouseover the pie, it will show the information from a pie that it represents. The cause of death is abreviated with a list of abreviations next to the pie. One of the interesting stories I found was that in 2010 and 2011 for Mexico, it looks like the number of homicides in Mexico equal to half or more than half of all total homicides deaths in the world. In 2010, the number of homicides world wide was 220 and 107 of those deaths are from Mexico. In 2011, the number of homicides in the world was 200 and 110 of those deaths are from Mexico.
